# Correlating-Genetic-Mutation-With-Ex-Vivo-Drug-Screening-Results
The project is to develop a promising approach to identify biomarkers that predict a strong response for the targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia by using machine learning methods. The approach will use the machine learning algorithm, the feature selection method to identify/select the gene expression for predicting the specified outcome from the BEAT AML datasets[1]. The BEAT AML is the largest to date dataset that offers AML samples like genomic, drug response data, etc. The implementation may include data pre-processing, feature selection and evaluation
